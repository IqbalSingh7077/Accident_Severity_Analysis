Observations in the dataset 
The Collisions dataset includes records of collisions happened on road from 2004 to Present. The dataset contains 194673 rows and 38 columns, each row is a record of accident, and each column is an attribute.

1.The first column "SEVERITYCODE" is the labeled data, which describes the fatality of an accident. . The remaining 37 columns have different types of attributes.Some or all can be used to train the model.
2.There are missing values. such as in "INTKEY" etc.
3.Data type of some attributes are not clear, such as "EXCEPTRSNCODE" etc.
4.The data has unbalanced labels for column "SEVERITYCODE", There are 136485 observations of label1 but only 58188 observations of label2.
5.Most of the feautres in the dataset will be cleaned in the pre-processing phase as some of the attributes are not useful in building a machine learning model.
